## Abstract

VoxCeleb datasets are widely used in speaker recognition studies. Our work serves two purposes.

First, we provide speaker age labels and (an alternative) annotation of speaker gender. 
  Second, we demonstrate the use of this metadata by constructing age and gender recognition models with different features and classifiers. We query different celebrity databases and apply consensus rules to derive age and gender labels. We also compare the original VoxCeleb gender labels with our labels to identify records that might be mislabeled in the original VoxCeleb data.
  
On modeling side, the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) in age regression, 9.443 years, is obtained using i-vector features with ridge regression. This indicates challenge in age estimation from in-the-wild style speech data.

- [best_models](best_models/): the best models reported in the paper, Linear Regression with i-Vectors (Age regression) and Logistic regression with i-Vectors (Gender recognition), are made available so that other users can try them in a variety of scenarios (assuming that features where computed as described)
- [notebooks](notebooks/): Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks used throughout the various steps

## Similar works
This work was carried out in 2020 when the first author was affiliated with University of Eastern Finland. The authors came later across an independent but [closely related work](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9414272) that addresses age labeling of VoxCeleb. The key difference between our work and theirs is that we assigned age labels based on the videos semantic and people identity, while they trained a facial age estimation model for the labeling task, taking as input the visual frames of the original YouTube videos. For readers convenience here it follows the paper's full reference, together with their github repo.
